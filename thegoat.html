    <div class="text-four">Sword Art Online truly is THE GOAT in my book. This may feel like a meme pick, but sadly it's not. I know it's hot garbage, but I just can't not watch it. This was one of the first anime I've watched, and while I may be biased, I still 1000% reccomend it to anyone. This is especially since it stars the Asuna, "best girl".</div>
