# Anime Website

With this website provided by The Odin Project, I hope to hone my skills further with HTML and CSS. I look forward to working with flexbox, different fonts, changing colors, etc.

**Update**: This was a really fun project, and it definitely helped me become more comfortable with coding in HTML and CSS. Working with flexbox made moving items very easy, and I was able to play around with HTML I didn't use before like border attributes and cropping photos down to a specific size. If I were to change anything moving forward, I would definitely try and reuse code more since a lot of the elements held similar attributes.
