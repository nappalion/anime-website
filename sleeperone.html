    <div class="text-four">Hajime no Ippo is truly a sleeper pick. With anime like Haikyuu bringing more people into the sports-genre for anime, I feel that Hajime no Ippo is a contender for one of the greatest sports-anime of all time. There was a lot of work put into animating this, and the writer for sure knows a ton about boxing.</div>
